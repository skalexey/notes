# notes
 This WEB app helps you learn playing a guitar using a real instrument. The app shows a picked guitar note on a musical staff. It uses input sound data from a selected sound input source (e.x. mic) and tries to recognize a note when you play it using your guitar. The recognized note will be shown on a corresponding position in a musical staff.
